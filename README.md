# universal-robots-kinematics

This work was developed in the context of our MSc dissertations: A Collaborative Work Cell toImprove Ergonomics and Productivity by João Cunha, and Human-Like Motion Generation through Waypoints for Collaborative Robots in Industry 4.0 by João Pereira, in which we got to work with the collaborative robotic arm UR10e. Before producing our kinematics solution, we conducteda literature review on the UR robots’ kinematics and realised there was a lack of thorough and detailed analysis of their kinematics. Additionally, we found the Universal Robots’ documentation confusing and unclear. Thus, the main goal of this work is to provide an explicit and transparent guide into the UR robotskinematics (more specifically the UR10e) by expanding on the literature we found: and describing every part of our analysis. We present a forward kinematic solution basedon the Modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an inverse kinematic solution based on ageometric analysis. These solutions were tested in CoppeliaSim using MATLAB through a remoteAPI.
