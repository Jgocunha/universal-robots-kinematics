# Launching the Simulation

To execute the simulation launch the *KinematicsTest.ttt* scene and run it. Afterwards, open the *main.m* script, choose the target joint values and run it. You should see the robot move to the eight inverse kinematic solutions and obtain a result similar to the figure below. Comparing the end-effector position calculated in MATLAB we can see it is equal to the value presented in *CoppeliaSim*. Moreover, in the MATLAB command window it is possible to verify that there is one inverse kinematic solution that is equal to the pre-defined target joint values, and that all the other solutions produce the same end-effector position in *CoppeliaSim*. Follow the following link for a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CGWcW34lxo) of simulation execution.
